The usage is very simple:
Press the command character in the master menu

Follow the instructions for menu related actions

A master array holds pointer of linkedlist of fooditems of 10 patrons.

As suggested in the description:

FoodItem is an abstract class and it becomes one due to declaring the copy function as pure virtual.
print function is defined for the attributes

Salmon(sideDish and way of cooking enum) TurkeySandwich(bread type enum and condiments linked list) and Eggplant Casserole(side Dish and no of ounces) are concrete classes and have their own data members over and above FoodItem.

They have dynamic invocation of print and copy virtual methods.
